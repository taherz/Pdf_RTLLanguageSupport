# Pdf_RTLLanguageSupport
Support right-to-left (RTL) languages (Arabic) in PDF in UWP (Universal Windows Platform)
- we used Syncfusion pdf lib in this example.

## Supported Language
- Arabic

## Known Issues
- it does not support all the fonts
- some of supported fonts it does not support the text with Tashkeel
- (long text wrapping issue)when the long line of text get wrapped, it write the lines as it is but from last to first so that the last line will be the first line in the paragraph and the first line will be the last line in the paragraph.

## How it works
- it take the arabic text word by word, each word takes its letters and draw them according to each letter position within the word.(Beginning, Middle, End, Isolated)
- each position of each letter has its own unicode character drawing.
